# StateCountryReact

Simple react application that queries an API for a list of countries which are then rendered in a dropdown.
The second dropdown will display a list of states depending on which country is selected.

NOTE: This was an educational project. Other users have added and removed items from the API, so certain requests will cause
the application to crash. In other words, feel free to read the source code for code styling and implementation, but realize
that it may not be free of bugs becuase of changes to the API dependancy.
